# Volcano MOD
Basic modifications to use a volcano hotend with the original V-Baby printhead.

Modified files:
- extend Fan Shroud (Volcano Layer Fan Shroud_1x_v4_.stl)
- extended Hotend Clamp / BL-Touch Mount (Volcano Layer Fan Shroud_1x_v4_.stl)

Be aware that the travel of BL-Touch sensors may wary a bit.
So test it carefully and adjust the thickness of the original BL-Touch spacer to match your sensor.
